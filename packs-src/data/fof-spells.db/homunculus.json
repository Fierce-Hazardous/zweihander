Examples include brooms, dolls, a small animal or windup toy. Homunculi are able to use the power of speech. You can only command a number of homunculi equal to your [WB] at any one time, but you may replace those which have been Slain!. A homunculus takes on the stats of a Homunculus or similar threat from Article 14: Threats. The only way to heal a homunculus from Damage is to cast this Spell again, but it does not require reagents and only takes ten minutes instead of one week. You begin to Bleed, no matter whether you succeeded or failed at using this Spell.</p>"
