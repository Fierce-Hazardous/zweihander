      "@en": "<p>Trouble is brewing, and with risk comes change. When two sides of any conflict begin to tear at each other&rsquo;s throats, they need people like me to champion their cause. I believe wholeheartedly in my allegiances and defend them every chance I get. Whether through public debate or a street brawl against my political opponents, I know that might makes right when it comes to pushing opinion. Some of those in charge see me as rash and violent, but when intentions turn away from peace, they rely on true believers like me to grab the narrative and shove it back our way.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have any regard for the rumors I keep hearing of things lurking in the shadows&mdash;the only true fight is against the other side&mdash;whoever they may be. My superiors are relying on me to lead the charge and shape the country into what they want, and who am I to deny them? Tales of demons, ghouls and witches are old wives&rsquo; tales meant to distract from the real conflict that peeks over the horizon daily.</p>"
