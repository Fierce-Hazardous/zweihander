      "@en": "<p>There is no greater feeling than being in the saddle atop a strong destrier racing with the wind. The horse is something I understand&mdash;while a simple Farmer sees them as a tool and others as simply a means of transportation, I see them as both a symbol of my status and a tool of war. A horse is not merely a luxury or a beast of burden, as it is truly an extension of one&rsquo;s skill. I was born in the saddle and, by the grace of Divine Providence, was blessed with exceptional horsemanship and the chance to use this gift to its fullest.</p>\n<p>I am skilled in an art many will never be able to take part in, and for that, I&rsquo;m truly blessed. My skills have been honed on the battlefields. I fight from the saddle, and due to my financial means, I am able to pay for the right to be in the Cavalry. Though I hear tales of things in the shadows, I laugh at such nonsense. War is in the air, and with its arrival, I once again take the saddle and bring the fight to the enemy&mdash;whoever they may be.</p>"
