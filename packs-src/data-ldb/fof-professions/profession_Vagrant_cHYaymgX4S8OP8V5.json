      "@en": "<p>The way I see it, people are divided into two types: the haves and the have-nots. I know that having nothing liberates me and allows me to look for freedom while those other folks sit miserably in their ivory towers. I&rsquo;m not a layabout or a tatterdemalion; if anything, I&rsquo;m more dynamic than most. I&rsquo;m not tied down by anyone or anything, leaving me free to do what I want and go where I please. The world is a cruel place, and life is hard, but with the wind at my back and satchel on my hip, I can&rsquo;t help but feel I took the best path.</p>\n<p>My ramblings have led me to many places, whether I&rsquo;m working for a meal or holding down a labor job for a few months. I&rsquo;ve seen and heard a lot, and some of it scares me. Sometimes when I&rsquo;m at my campsite warming my supper, I hear things in the dark that don&rsquo;t sound like any animal I&rsquo;ve ever heard. I&rsquo;ve heard rumors all throughout the country of dark things, and it&rsquo;s always the same story: out there, just beyond our vision, something is shifting and stirring. What it is exactly, I&rsquo;m not sure, but I&rsquo;ll bet my last pence it&rsquo;s nothing good.</p>"
