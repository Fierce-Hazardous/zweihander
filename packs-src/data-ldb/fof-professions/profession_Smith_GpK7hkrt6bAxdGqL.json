      "@en": "<p>With fire and hammer, I take metal and forge it into objects not only useful but also beautiful in their craftsmanship. People take horseshoes, plows and castiron pans for granted, but when their horse throws a shoe, I become the most critical merchant in town. When I have no orders, I let my creative mind wander at the forge&mdash;forging beautiful cavalry sabres or ornate iron sculptures. Through my hands and knowledge, I bring meaning and function to a chaotic world.</p>\n<p>War is coming, though. I have seen the signs and heard the arguments, and I know humankind has a propensity to be unyielding when faced with difference. Humankind is like iron: once it is forged, it is nearly impossible to reshape. However, some nights when I dwell late by the forge, I feel a prickling on the back of my neck&mdash;like someone is watching me, waiting. I&rsquo;ve heard stirrings of things at the edge of the cities. If worse comes to worse though, I am certain I can forge a blade to vanquish whatever is coming.</p>"
