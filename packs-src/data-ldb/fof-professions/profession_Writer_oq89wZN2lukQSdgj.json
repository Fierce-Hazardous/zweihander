      "@en": "<p>Pay heed, my friend, because I am not some talentless quill diver! By one stroke of the pen, I can rally anyone to a cause. It might be through the letters I send to one of the numerous newspapers decrying taxation. Or the demands from Indigenous Nations to the European powers who promise to reimburse them in this time of theft. Perhaps I might pen a broadsheet in which I speak out against the rabble-rousing Rebels!</p>\n<p>As the tensions grow, my quill is more critical than ever. Words win wars, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter which side I choose, for it remains my duty to sway opinions in favor of whomever I follow. Others may dismiss me as a firebrand or a nebbish person whose only defense is an inkpot&mdash;but I care little. I take my responsibilities as seriously as any soldier&rsquo;s sworn duty. I only speak the truth, and any of those other writers who put forth frivolous rumors of evil manifest are little more than charlatans looking to make a quick shilling.</p>"
