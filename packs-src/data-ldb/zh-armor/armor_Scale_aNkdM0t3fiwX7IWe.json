      "@en": "As a relatively new-fangled approach to reproducing plate armor at a more generous cost, scale armor is a far cry cheaper than its contemporary. Made of overlapping disks (or rectangular plates) of thin metal, it makes the wearer look akin to a fish or some other nautical creature. Oftentimes, scale is decorated with pearls and seashells, only further underscoring its namesake. Fortunately, it affords better protection than mail, but has a considerable amount of weight."
