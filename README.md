An implementation of the Zweih√§nder Grim & Perilous d100 RPG system for FoundryVTT.

## Features

### Automated Profession Advances
Professions automatically import related traits and talents to your sheet.

#### Buy profession advances
Buy your profession advances directly from the sheet. If an item of the right type and name exist in your world item collection or in compendia, it is automatically imported!

#### Reward points tracking
Reward points are automatically tracked - if you wish so.

### Drag & Drop
Drag & Drop is enabled in various places in order to enable intuitive user interaction.

### Fortune Tracker

Easily track fortune points for your party and choose from two fortune rule systems:
1. One-way (using misfortune points removes them from the game)
2. Ebb-and-flow (using misfortune points convertes them back to fortune points)

### Themes
While we currently just support a dark theme and a light theme, support for easy re-colorization of the systems sheets is on our roadmap!

### Your Game - Your Rules
This system aims to be very customizable. While it is a comprehensive implementation of the standard Zweihander d100 system (with its list of skills, professions, talents, traits, etc.), we want to support creative GMs and enable easy modifications to the system. Therefore, you can populate the system with as much individual, home-brew content as you like. In a future release it will also be possible to modify the list of skills.
If you have suggestions on ways to allow for more customization, [feel free to reach out](#contact)!
