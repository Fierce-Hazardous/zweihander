Blessing in Disguise,trait,hand-of-god,"It is said that Humans have been watched over by a god who favors them above all other Ancestries. But perhaps this blessing represents the attentions of Abyssal fiends acting of their own accord, waiting to turn you into a thrall once your fate runs dry.","Whenever the time calls for you to suffer a debilitating Injury or face death, you may alternatively gain 1 permanent Chaos Rank (instead of spending a Fate Point) to ignore it entirely."
Danger Sense,trait,awareness,"A rare few Humans tend to get a “funny feeling” whenever a situation may turn dangerous. This danger sense also leads to odd dreams, and sometimes plagues them with unusual visions during their waking hours.","Whenever you are Surprised, spend one Fortune Point to avoid it and take your Turn as normal."
Dauntless,trait,deadly-strike,"Humans’ sheer force of will helps them withstand many challenges. Rarely do they cross the threshold to fear and darkness, as their stalwart nature shields them from the horrors that surround them.",You are immune to the effects of the Intimidate Skill and cannot be Stunned or Knocked Out!
Esoteric Memory,trait,brain-stem,"Some Humans have a preternatural ability for remembering details and subconsciously committing things to memory. They may even develop odd rituals to help jog their memories. A scholar would say these Humans have an eidetic memory, recalling every detail with great clarity.","When attempting to recall a particular detail or remember a fact, you always succeed at Scrutinize Tests."
Fortune's Wheel,trait,honeypot,"Some Humans are favored by Lady Luck. In a sense, they are her emissaries in an unkind and capricious world, either victims of its accidents or beneficiaries of its boons.","Anytime you generate a Critical Failure after rolling D100, automatically add one Fortune Point into the Fortune Pool."
Grim Resolve,trait,armor-upgrade,"Humans are extremely durable and their force of will unparalleled. When the chips are down, they manage to pull themselves up by the bootstraps.","Immediately after you suffer Damage from a melee or ranged weapon, spend a Fortune Point to ignore it entirely, therefore negating both Damage and any Injuries you may have suffered.You may even use this after failing to Dodge or Parry."
Manifest Destiny,trait,orb-direction,"Humans are a quick study and carry with them a wealth of experiences.

Mixed Bloodline,trait,transfuse,One of your Human ancestors or parents coupled with another Ancestry and passed elements of this bloodline down to their children.,"Randomly generate another Ancestry other than your own. Whichever you end up with, consider possible alterations to your appearance and cultural values. Should you share Dwarven heritage, you may have a mercurial disposition. If sharing Elven heritage, you may fly into fey rages when things don’t go your way. If sharing Gnome heritage, you may like to break things apart in hopes of learning how they work. If sharing Halfling heritage, you may exhibit an insatiable appetite for larceny. Finally, if sharing Ogre heritage, you may possess a predilection towards eating every morsel you can get your grubby mitts on.
Randomly generate your Mixed Bloodline by rolling D100, consulting the Ancestral table on Step III: Sex & Ancestry. As a result, you may randomly determine another Ancestral Trait outside of the Human’s Mixed Bloodline. Once determined, go to the first page of the Character sheet and record your Mixed Bloodline under Background and record your new Ancestral Trait."
Mountain Amongst Men,trait,mountain-top,"Some Humans are incredibly tall, towering over their own kind. Being a hulking brute may have negative social consequences, as they are oftentimes perceived as being clumsy, dunderheaded or somewhat terrifying. Are these assertions correct? You decide.","You are able to wield any two-handed melee weapon with one hand. This also means you may freely take advantage of the Adaptable Quality for weapons using only one hand. Finally, you will reference “91 to 100” on the Height table and will have a Husky build on the Build table."
Natural Selection,trait,divided-spiral,"Favored above all others, Humans are the living instruments of the gods. A thankless few are granted an inkling of their might.

Noble Savage,trait,mountain-climbing,"Whether through purposeful training or accident, Humans have developed a natural resistance to the elements.",You never suffer physical Peril as a result of failed Toughness Tests.
Seventh Sense,trait,nose-side,"Some Humans possess an unusual mutation, allowing them to visualize scents in the air.

Cavesight,trait,night-vision,"Dwarves senses are attuned to the earth below.

Children of the Earth,trait,muscle-fat,"Dwarves have an almost magnetic pull toward the earth. This, combined with a lower center of gravity, makes a Dwarf nigh impossible to topple. This obstinacy is unmatched, save for the fact that the mountain does not bend to the wishes of the wind.","You can never be forced off your feet or knocked Prone onto the ground by the elements, your enemies or even Magick. Finally, you will have a Corpulent build on the Build table."
Consume Alcohol,trait,beer-stein,"Dwarves possess an unusually high resistance to the poisonous effects of alcohol and tobacco. But the stink of these vices cling to their clothes and breath, marking them less desired among the well-landed.","While Intoxicated, you never suffer from the negative effects associated with this condition. You can learn more about Intoxication in Chapter 9: Hazards & Healing."
Dwarven Warfare,trait,warhammer,"Dwarves use their lower center of gravity to drive cold steel into their opponent, crushing armor and shattering bones beneath its impact.

Grudgebearer,trait,bookmarklet,"Dwarves harbor ancestral hatred, bringing violence upon hated enemies. Perceived grievances – both real and imagined – and general bigotry fuel this rage.","Whenever you use Fury Dice to determine weapon Damage, they explode on face ‘5-6’.

Oathkeeper,trait,griffin-shield,"Like their forefathers, Dwarves have become the bearers of ancient trade secrets. Renowned as master builders, their craft has been perfected over the ages. They jealously guard the secrets of their work, passing these ancient rituals to their children.

Physical Prowess,trait,atlas,"Dwarves are naturally athletic, excelling at feats most normal people could never hope to achieve.

Additionally, you may substitute Athletics in place of Coordination when Dodging ranged weapons. Finally, you will have a Husky build on the Build table."
Rune-Marked Glory,trait,rune-stone,"Sage and arcane, all Dwarves know their runes. They mark keepsakes, armor and weapons with chalk and ink, telling of an ancient, forgotten glory

sorcery.","Whenever you suffer Damage or Peril from Magick, spend a Fortune Point to ignore it entirely. Note that this does not alleviate any additional effects the Magick spell may also cause (such as being caught
On Fire or knocked Prone)."
Stentorian Voice,trait,carillon,"Dwarves have a loud and booming voice, and when they speak, others listen. They break out in song often, recounting tales of vendettas, unending turmoil and unresolved grievances towards other races. It can become incredibly annoying to their non-Dwarven comrades, as they must put up with their inability to hold a tune.","Whenever you use Fellowship-based Skills, refer to either your Brawn or Fellowship Primary
Attribute (whichever is highest)."
Stoneheaded,trait,rock,"Dwarves are stern and taciturn, unyielding to manipulation. Born with an innate ability to see through Magickal deception and trickery, their mind is unyielding. Changing their perception is incredibly difficult, as they are stubborn in belief and pragmatic in nature.",You are immune to Magick which may control your mind and see through illusions without fail.
Strength of the Mountain,trait,mountains,Dwarves can perform incredible feats of stamina. They claim that even the smallest runt of their clans can haul a hogshead of mead without breaking a sweat.,"Any Skill Rank you acquire that relies on the Brawn Primary Attribute modifies your Base Chance by +15, instead of +10."
Bewitching,trait,cowled,"Elves are striking to behold and others have a difficult time concentrating on anything else but their beauty. Often fashion conscious, their clothing is striking and evocative, liberal with its use of lace and high of collar. But beneath this veneer lies an insidious and alien power to bend people to their whim.","Whenever you cast Magick to control minds or use the Charm Skill on others, foes must flip their results to fail to Resist its effects. However, this only works if your foe can both see and hear you."
Beyond the Veil,trait,cowled,"Elves share a significant link with powers beyond mortal kith and kin and can manipulate them to their will. But, they have slowly fallen prey to the mind-bending warp and weft of the world beyond.","Whenever you fail or Critically Fail an Incantation Test, spend one Fortune Point to turn it into a Critical Success."
Deadly Aim,trait,cowled,"The world around Elves seems to fade to a blur as they fire their bows, striking between the chinks in their foe’s armor with perfection. They may pridefully (and purposefully) blind one eye with a bandana to illustrate their skills... or should they grow insane, gouge it out entirely with a spoon
to prove their unyielding dedication.","Whenever you make an Attack Action or Perilous Stunt using a ranged weapon, foes must flip the results to fail to Dodge, Parry or Resist it."
Enduring Mortality,trait,cowled,"Although not all Elves are immortal, some still hold that flicker of divinity within their blood, passed down from their Fey ancestry. Their features may change over these long decades, but some Elves never appear neither old nor ugly. Even horrid scars seem to accentuate their youthful and vigorous features.

Fey Treachery,trait,cowled,"Some Elven kindred are suspicious and deeply secretive. Like them, you can be capricious and sullen. You are always ready to spring upon interlopers without a second thought.","Your first successful Attack Action against a foe adds a 1D6 Fury Die to your Damage results. This can be used against multiple foes during combat, taking advantage of your traitorous ways!"
Firstborn,trait,cowled,"The Elves came to this world first, the favored children of nameless gods. Their radiant perfection has been carefully preserved in the histories of your kin through written and oral traditions. This age-long lineage has made your people distant and fickle, but it has also given them insight beyond the Ætheric Veil and nature of the world around them.","Whenever learning new Magicks, you always succeed at your Incantation Test. Additionally, you never have to sacrifice Reward Points to finalize the process. You can learn more in Chapter 10: Grimoire."
Kindred Warband,trait,cowled,"Elves can be perceived as being particularly aloof and taciturn, sticking to their own. Contemptible as their disdain towards others may be, it is this preternatural intuition that makes Elves incredibly dangerous when fighting side-by-side.","When fighting alongside other Elves, you gain a +10 Base Chance to strike with Attack Actions and Perilous Stunts."
Lament of the Ages,trait,cowled,"Elves live many decades beyond other Ancestries, but this longevity comes at a cost. In time, the petty concerns of the mortal coil weigh too heavily upon many Elves, giving birth to a melancholy that gives way to bouts of unmitigated rage, even nihilism. Others react instinctively to this behavior with great trepidation.","Whenever combat begins, select one foe. If the foe can clearly see and hear you, they must reduce all Damage they do to you by your [FB]."
Meditative Healing,trait,cowled,"Gifted with the kindred’s ability to live between the weave of the world, you have learned how to harness an inner power to mend your own wounds.","Whenever you awaken from a good night’s sleep, you move one step up the Damage Condition Track positively. This means that if you were Grievously Wounded, you are now Seriously Wounded instead. Note that this does not ‘cure’ Injuries."
Nature's Own,trait,cowled,"Wild Elves have lived amongst the forest, beneath the jungle canopy, atop the highest mountain and even below the earth. With burrs, leaves, mud and the like clinging to their clothing, they emerge unwashed from the wilderness, acknowledging
little reason to clean themselves up for civilized company.","You leave no trace of your passing in rural areas or above ground, unless discovered by Magick or a Critically
Succeeded Awareness Test."
Nighteyes,trait,cowled,"Although Elves are not able to see completely in the dark, they can see clearly in the dim light of stars. It’s evident that you’re an Elf when in these conditions, as your eyes tend to flash with their own light like an animal’s. This is the first sign of chaos made manifest in the Elven Ancestry. It is enough to drive dim-witted peasants to demand that “the demon be
hung by their neck until the lights go out”.","You can see completely in the dark above ground as if it were full daylight, provided there is starlight or
moonlight in the sky."
Warrior's Tattoo,trait,cowled,"Intricate knots of indigo ink are painted or tattooed upon the bodies of Elven warriors, symbols of their might and prowess.

Clockworks of War,trait,cowled,"Telescoping muzzles, switchblade-style two-handed swords, cog- driven crossbows and folding axes are only the tip of the iceberg of what can be accomplished by modifying implements of war.","Provided you have the appropriate tools, any two- handed weapon can be modified into a compact one- handed version (which only you can wield). Despite being one-handed, it retains its original function, but now has an Encumbrance of 1."
Crag Fighting,trait,cowled,"Living amongst the hills and mountains, Gnomes have adopted a particular edge in combat. Using subterfuge and guile, you cleverly outpace foes using guerilla strike tactics.",You may Maneuver after any Melee Attack for 0 Action Points.
Denizen Of Stone,trait,cowled,"Whenever Gnomes go to sleep, it is whispered that they turn to stone. While this seems like a wild tale, there seems to be some truth to it. Their skin oft turns a shade of grey as they rest as if all the blood had been drained from their veins!","You are never left Helpless for any reason, and thus cannot be made victim to a coup de grâce: your skin is turned entirely to stone as a preternatural defense mechanism whenever you’re Helpless."
Dungeons Deep,trait,cowled,"Gnomes are not a prodigious people. In fact, finding a living, breathing Gnome below ground is rare indeed. They pass soundlessly throughout the caverns below the earth, roaming the ‘under dark’ in solitude. Besides, who would go looking after this much-maligned race of people in the first place?","You leave no trace of your passing in underground areas or caves whatsoever, unless discovered by Magick or at a Critically Successful Awareness Test."

Goldbergian,trait,cowled,"From devising mouse trap-styled children’s games to the chain- reactive devices that oscillate endlessly in your workshop, you have created a number of deliberately over-engineered machines in your time.

Hocus Pocus,trait,cowled,Gnomes have a penchant for manifesting sorcerous falsehoods which cannot be ignored.,"Whenever a foe fails to Resist your Magicks, they Critically Fail instead."
Metrognome,trait,cowled,"You are downright obsessive and clockwork-like in your mannerisms.

Thieving Stunties,trait,cowled,"These Gnomes are a hair shorter than their kin. They find it easy to hide in gardens, particularly because they have a propensity to wear red caps and fake white beards!","Foes must flip their results to fail all Attack Actions or Perilous Stunts made with ranged weapons against you. However, you cannot wield two-handed weapons, carry a shield and must reduce your Movement by 3. Finally, you will reference “1 to 10” on the Height table and will have a Frail build on the Build table."
Tunnel Vision,trait,cowled,"Like their Dwarven cousins, Gnomes have especially-attuned senses below the earth. Using a preternatural sense of touch, they can ‘ feel’ their way around the underworld.","You can see completely in the dark below ground as if it were daylight, providing you are able to use your hands freely."
Underfoot,trait,cowled,"Living below the world in a burrow has made Gnome backs crooked. Because of this, they hobble around like old men, not necessarily dawdling, but quickly scurrying about, beneath the line of sight for most folk.",Add +3 to your Initiative.
Wretched Prankster,trait,cowled,"Poking fun at their personal flaws and faults in their armor, you annoy your foes to the point of weakness.","At your discretion, you may use your Guile Skill to both Dodge and Parry."
Beguiler,trait,cowled,"Halfling lies are hard to tell from truth, and you can use this to your advantage. With a string of insults and chiding, you infuriate and distract your opponent.","Reference either your [FB] or [BB] for the purposes of determining Damage Threshold. Additionally, you may substitute Guile in place of any Combat-based Skill when Parrying attacks."
Cat-like Reflexes,trait,cowled,"Some say that Halflings are watched over by Abyssal demons. Those with this affectation are oftentimes shadowed by a black cat or have it as a beloved pet, ‘found ’ at their doorstep as a kitten.","Whenever you fall, you may spend one Fortune Point to avoid Damage. In this case, you land on your feet, apparently unharmed. You can learn more about falling in Chapter 9: Hazards & Healing."
Craven,trait,cowled,"Some Halflings are almost laughably faint-hearted, ready to bolt at a moment’s notice. Cowardice has its place, particularly when a Halfling ne’er-do-well wishes to keep their hide intact.",You may flip the results to succeed at Combat-based Skill Tests to Parry attacks made with melee weapons.
Farsight,trait,cowled,"Whether Halflings are searching for something the size of a dormouse or making out the details of a coach laden with riches, they can clearly discern the smallest of details from half a mile away.

Fettered Chaos,trait,cowled,"The Halfling Ancestry is incredibly resilient despite its less than imposing physique. They illustrate an inexorable spiritual resistance towards the lure of Corruption and madness, a blessing given to them by their maker.","Whenever you suffer Corruption, decrease the number you gain by three (to a minimum of one). This means that if you suffer 6 Corruption, you gain 3 instead."
Fieldwarden,trait,cowled,"Halfling women and men are taught at a young age to wield an array of weapons to defend themselves and their homeland. When so armed, Halflings can unleash a devastating storm of death upon their enemies.",Ignore the Weak Quality of all ranged weapons you wield.
Fleet-Footed,trait,cowled,"In tense situations, Halflings hop madly like rabbits, being remarkably fast on their feet. This is particularly fortunate when they need to tuck and roll when attacked, but does absolutely no good when a Halfling needs to hike from one end of the shire to the mouth of a far-flung volcano.","Whenever you Charge or Run, add +6 yards to Movement."
Hijinks,trait,cowled,"Sly in their ways, Halflings use their vexing mannerisms and general under-footedness to confound the tall folk. These pranks are meant to annoy, as Halflings love to make others an ass to their japes.","Whenever you suffer Damage from a melee weapon, spend a Fortune Point to ignore it entirely."
Kleptomania,trait,cowled,"Halflings are gifted with the ability to use illusion and sleight of hand tricks to make things disappear. Their hands may wander off on their own to nick things, only to realize later they find something stuffed in their pocket that wasn’t there before!","Whenever you are in a pinch and need one object that could realistically fit into your pocket, spend one Fortune Point to automatically find it within. For instance, you could use this to produce a single silver shilling (ss) from your pockets, but not several silver shillings (ss) without spending an equal number of Fortune Points."
Low Blow,trait,cowled,"When cornered, a Halfling will resort to nasty tricks to fell a foe.

You must be Engaged with a foe in order to use a Low Blow."
Memento,trait,cowled,"Most Halfling toddlers are given a precious keepsake to cherish. Typically, this is a bauble, cameo, necklace or ring – something Halflings can hold close to their hearts. This memento brings comfort and solace in the face of danger. However, other Halfling pickpockets may covet this treasure for themselves.","When carrying your memento, your Disorder’s effects may be temporarily ignored for 24 hours by spending a Fortune Point. In special cases, at the GM’s discretion, it may be given to another to confer its benefits."

However, you cannot wield two-handed weapons, carry a shield and must reduce your Movement by 3. Finally, you will reference “1 to 10” on the Height table and will have a Frail build on the Build table."
Broad-Bellied,trait,cowled,"Your staggering girth has gifted you with the ability to haul anything without breaking a sweat. Unfortunately, it also means that every Halfling you meet wants you to help them move from their old hovel to a new one.","You entirely ignore the effects of Overage, unless the value is in excess of two times your Initiative or Movement."
Cast Iron Stomach,trait,cowled,"The most important part of an Ogre’s biology is their gut. Their heavily muscled bellies contain most of their vital organs. Their stomachs are also monstrously powerful and able to digest nearly anything, a natural mutation resulting from generations of extreme gluttony.","You can gain sustenance from eating literally anything, including inanimate objects.This protects you from starvation entirely, as described in Chapter 9: Hazards & Healing."
Cruisin' For A Bruisin',trait,cowled,"Some Ogres have reaped the full benefits of their omnivorous diets from birth – mother’s milk, raw meat, dirt, Elven trinkets, swamp gas, human livers and tears – and are infused with great size and physical potency.","You may reference either [BB] or [CB] with any melee weapons you wield, including those which possess the Throwing Quality."
Frightening Bellow,trait,cowled,"Ogre lungs are nearly as powerful as Ogre
stomachs. Lots of decibels are required to
fully celebrate the glory of beheading a foe or
gutting a fawn for a tasty treat. This gives
them amazing vocal capabilities, letting
them rip out massive and terrifying roars as intimidation.","Whenever you succeed at an Intimidate Test, the foes you intimidated also suffer from Stress. If it is a Critical Success, they suffer from Fear instead."
Gut-Plate,trait,cowled,"Your great belly is covered in an outer carapace of bones and muscles. Unfortunately, it makes for an easy target.

You also gain the benefits of the Natural Quality in these cases."
Hunger Pangs,trait,cowled,Ogres often forget their gustatory exploits until faced with extreme situations. Bracing flashbacks of these orgiastic meals are then triggered – mandrake root; rivers of mead; endless heaps of meat!,"Whenever you successfully Resist the effects of Stress, Fear, Terror or other effects that force you to make a Resolve Test, you immediately gain the benefits of one dose of mandrake root. If this is a Critical Success, you gain the benefits of three doses instead. When under Hunger Pang’s effects, you do not suffer the drawbacks normally associated with taking mandrake root."
Mighty Thews,trait,cowled,"Ogres are all massive, but many possess tiny hands. However, a rarer breed has hands in proportion to the rest of their body. These mighty specimens can easily handle turning the spit over a fire on their own.","You are able to wield any two-handed melee weapon with one hand.This also means you may freely take advantage of the Adaptable Quality for weapons using one hand. Whenever you gain the benefits of the Adaptable Quality, you may add +2 to Total Damage, instead of the normal +1."
Odd Couple,trait,cowled,"Not many trust Ogres, but they have found an unlikely ally in Halflings. Perhaps it is their mutual love of food and alcohol, or even commiseration about being underdogs. Either way, ‘civilized ’ Ogres dwell in Halfling settlements, and their attitude towards each other is more a friendly rivalry than actual pure camaraderie.","When fighting alongside Halfling allies, you gain a +10 Base Chance to strike with Attack Actions and Perilous Stunts."
Rotgut Spray,trait,cowled,"Ogres have a natural predilection towards drink. Due to their almost furnace-like guts, they can ignite any alcohol they ingest to shoot it back out as a gout of flame. This is both very dangerous
and quite entertaining.","After consuming an entire bottle of rotgut, you can belch it up as flaming breath. Treat this breath as a bottle bomb. However, you must immediately
make a Toughness Test or become Intoxicated."
Slamdance,trait,cowled,"By bringing a powerful, hammy fist downwards to crush a foe, they also let fly their flintstone-like feet. This generally puts their enemies right where they want them: on the ground,
ready for skewering.","Whenever you make a successful Stunning Blow, you force a foe to Resist a Takedown as well. You must attack with weapons possessing the Pummeling or Weak Quality to utilize this Talent."
Thick Lining,trait,cowled,"Butchers, hunters and meal-preparers are some of the most important people in Ogre society. Those whose job it is to slaughter often expose themselves to the deadly natural poisons of tainted meats.

Wendigo,trait,cowled,"Some Ogres in northern regions have grown protective layers of blubber fat and thick white hair grows in large tufts all over their bodies.
