However, this does not stop the common folk from wanting to remember their ancestors, where they came from and the histories that preceded them. Those whose job it is within these villages to remember and pass on these stories are known as Oathkeepers, warrior-poets who in their communities are as respected as any tribal leader. An Oathkeeper is a sacred position and it is their responsibility to know their people’s apocrypha – tales of heroes and villains, droughts and rainfall, gods and demons – and to pass it onto the younglings of the village. Oathkeepers also keep track of community agreements, marriages, trades and vendettas, usually recorded in their namesake ‘book of oaths’. Some Oathkeepers also study events about the world at large, and can talk just as easily about a war between two empires as their village’s last harvest.\\nGiven their duties, Oathkeepers rarely keep to one place. Many were Skalds, used to travelling between tribal villages, a kind of itinerant teacher and vagabond. As Oathkeepers age, they grow stubborn in their ways, lamenting the ‘old days’ and ‘how it used to be’. These Oathkeepers first foment resistance against change and progress, then outright sedition against any rulers they deem unfit. If successful, their words have been known to raise armies. Armed insurrections are nothing new, but when they are led by a twisted yet trusted warrior, they are much more difficult to put down. Ethnocentric violence, pogroms and other atrocities are said to be fed from the propaganda and agitprop that is purveyed by corrupted Oathkeepers."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least one Skill Rank in Folklore in order to enter this Expert Profession."},"archetype":{"value":"Expert Profession"},"bonusAdvances":[{"name":"[CB]"},{"name":"[FB]"},{"name":"[IB]"},{"name":"[IB]"},{"name":"[PB]"},{"name":"[WB]"},{"name":"[WB]"}],"skillRanks":[{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Folklore"},{"name":"Leadership"},{"name":"Martial Melee"},{"name":"Resolve"},{"name":"Rumor"},{"name":"Scrutinize"},{"name":"Simple Melee"},{"name":"Survival"},{"name":"Warfare"}],"talents":[{"linkedId":null,"name":"Bad Axx!"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Impervious Mind"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Secret Signs"}],"professionalTrait":{"name":"Book of Oaths","linkedId":null},"specialTrait":{"name":"","linkedId":null},"drawback":{"name":"Book of Grudges","linkedId":null},"tier":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9cilLhNTlIyJpmtZ":3},"flags":{"zweihander":{}}}

Over time, they find their skin hardens and begins to flake, starting at their feet and spreading upwards across their whole body. Twisted by their befouled Covenants, their skin becomes stone, their voices become hoarse and gravid with calcified, stony might. The most powerful Sirocco Prophets are nigh immobile, but this is seen as an honor and a true conduit of the Hellfurnace’s power.

They have no center of worship as most are individualists who simply heard the call of the wild and returned to her bosom. Druids are mystical and possess an unmatched lust for wildlife that sees them often consort oddly with flora and fauna – and each other. They also come to embody the fury and gentle nature of the Demiurge, taking on their god’s dualistic nature in their actions and their sex. Druids dress simply in clothing that the Demiurge gives to them from nature. The Demiurge is both the god of nature and the god of childbirth, so those who wish to carry child often seek counsel from a Druid.\nDruids worship in primordial areas that predate mankind – old growth glades, amidst bones of enormous long-dead behemoths and before ancient stone monoliths that have stood for time immemorial. Here they feel their beloved Demiurge’s primal warmth and can engage in passionate worship, love, and copulation – though not excessively so. Druidic prayers draw from nature, for example, communicating with animals or tapping into nature’s primal fury. If a Druid feels the pull of the Abyss, they turn their backs on primeval worship, jubilantly worshipping in ancient forbidden ways: mass orgies with animals, human sacrifice and offering up newborns to the Demiurge by abandoning them in the wild."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least one Skill Rank in Incantation in order to enter this Expert Profession.

Truthsayers work alongside Scholars of all sorts, and many are the preeminent authorities on religion and apocryphal histories. Truthsayers also serve as judges and arbitrators: townsfolk who cannot afford Barristers seek the counsel of a Truthsayer to resolve any dispute involving money, land or lineage. Many see Truthsayers as the least religious of all priesthoods, for they take an objective, theological approach towards the divine. This is simply untrue, as Truthsayers believe the purpose of divinity is to reveal all knowledge and truth, no matter how frightening it may be. The Learner’s worship also extends to arcanists and craftsmen, as anything that requires knowledge falls under His purview.\nLearner temples are massive libraries, chronicling the histories of both their faith and the known world. Truthsayer worship often revolves around deep meditation, communing with their god and chronicling the past and present. Truthsayers also use their prayers to dispense justice and offer rulings. Those that become too absorbed by their erudite ways use their terrible knowledge and insight to give unfair rulings, altering verdicts and condemning innocents for sheer pleasure. Others seek to upend other faiths, condemning them as they counsel inquisitors to erase these perceived ‘heretical’ religions from the face of the earth.

Lesson one: you can’t earn anything in this world. The justice system is often corrupt and exploitative, and there is a certain stripe of criminal the system loves to exploit. Enter the Convict: a petty miscreant who knows nothing else but incarceration. Following their release from having served their first jail sentence, unable to find work which society would let them do, they committed another crime, got caught, and found themselves back in the fortified jail only a fortnight after having been released. This is a pattern that has repeated itself again and again. Some Convicts never escape the pattern, some look for a way out and become adventurers. Convicts are not sneaky rogues or dashing swashbucklers – they are firebugs and drug peddlers, pimps and grifters, rebels and bandits who have become resigned to a fate which imprisonment leavened by a few weeks’ freedom. Serious incarceration is a rarity – usually a few days in a Reeve’s jail or an evening in the stockades functions well enough to deter most criminals. The vilest of criminals are locked up deep in castle dungeons, cast-off to man the walls of far-flung fortresses, press-ganged into the navy and forced to become a sailor or even exiled upon an island of like-minded criminals. Surprisingly, death sentences are reserved for blue-blooded nobles to make an example out of. Justice has a strange predilection towards reform, but the Convict is rarely assuaged by it, returning to their roots often after having been reprimanded.\nWhen a Convict is finally released from their confinement, many will adventure because few places will employ a former criminal. This brings us to lesson two: a man will do anything he can to survive. Life inside changes many Convicts – they become hard and brutal, learning how to best protect themselves and the handful of people they place even a small amount of trust in. Many are ruthless and unfeeling, able to kill at a moment’s notice if it means their survival. Though some Convicts are wrongly imprisoned as scapegoats or from misunderstandings, there are many, many more who actually deserve their punishment. From this, we learn the third and most important lesson: life is pain and death. Once they have been let out of jail, they will fulfill their bloodlust or primal urges by preying on their unsuspecting fellows."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":false,"requirements":""},"archetype":{"value":"Socialite"},"bonusAdvances":[{"name":"[AB]"},{"name":"[CB]"},{"name":"[CB]"},{"name":"[FB]"},{"name":"[IB]"},{"name":"[PB]"},{"name":"[WB]"}],"skillRanks":[{"name":"Athletics"},{"name":"Folklore"},{"name":"Guile"},{"name":"Intimidate"},{"name":"Resolve"},{"name":"Rumor"},{"name":"Scrutinize"},{"name":"Simple Melee"},{"name":"Stealth"},{"name":"Toughness"}],"talents":[{"linkedId":null,"name":"Holdout"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Lightning Reaction"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Light Sleeper"}],"professionalTrait":{"name":"Jailhouse Rock","linkedId":null},"specialTrait":{"name":"","linkedId":null},"drawback":{"name":"","linkedId":null},"tier":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9cilLhNTlIyJpmtZ":3},"flags":{"zweihander":{}}}

Often discovered through vision quests in the wilderness or near-death experiences with Primeval creatures, Skinwalkers seem to obtain the traits of their primal guardian; the cunning of a silverback warg, the strength of a barrel- bellied orc or what have you. Those of a more academic bend chalk this up to simple self-realization, but when viewed through the lens of Magickal insight, these warriors do seem to emanate some sort of animistic, otherworldly energy.\\nSkinwalkers, regardless of their culture, are highly- respected individuals who serve as paragons for everything their clan stands for. However, shamen warn fresh-to-the- fold Skinwalkers of the danger of relying too much on these spirits, for they are very old and not completely benevolent. Those who do not heed these warnings start to take on a more physical appearance of their Primeval - the water panther causes the skin to become squamous and rigid, the howlbear causes the Skinwalker’s shoulders to become hunched or webbing between digits and limbs for those who worship of death bats. Eventually, these Skinwalkers who have given into their desire for power become more beast than man, and are either banished, imprisoned or killed.

Courtesans know the value of their sex appeal - not only can it buy them houses and fine clothes, but can also buy information.

However, that doesn’t make them immune from tragedy. If a countess is both powerful enough and ignoble enough, the words of their extramarital affairs can be silenced with a court order or even an assassin’s blade. Courtesans that escape the red dagger are thrown below the status of the lowliest beggars, seen as tramps, liars and manipulators. Even if they had lofty goals of bringing despots to justice or shame, those get easily dashed if love letters or evidence of their petty treasons are discovered. These low Courtesans have lost their good name and will look for repairers of reputation to help them return to a normal life.

That said, art serves as an escape from the terrible rigors of a grim & perilous world and serves as the tapestry of history to a largely illiterate world. Most artists and performers are little more than journeymen, their talents enough to earn them a living, painting portraits of merchants or minor nobles or strutting the boards in front of one village after another as part of a travelling theater, but others are truly talented. As their talent grows, so does their renown, until they become the Maestros who create great works of art. Whether a playwright, a composer, a sculptor or a painter, Maestros are the masters of their craft who become the darlings of the poor and the elite alike. Maestros can achieve a level of fame rarely seen outside of royalty. Playwrights like Wilhelm Speerschüttler or painters like Johannes Weisz are not only well-known in their own countries, but often around the world.\\n The Maestro’s reputation and position in the public eye are what allow them to continue following their passions, but this also puts unimaginable pressure on them. They are constantly pestered by high-ranking members of royalty, the nobility and the clergy, seeking commissions for ever greater pieces of art or mobbed in the streets by their fanatic followers. Further, everything they do is dissected down to the minutest detail – broadsheets spread salacious rumors of opiate-fueled abuse and romantic trysts, their admirers follow them like scorned lovers and their creative wells dry up due to this pressure. Some Maestros withstand the pressure and able to draw from their creative well again and again, but for some, the pressure is too much. They are driven mad by the use of alcoholic spirits like Green Fairy, and begin to draw from it as inspiration. Thus, their art and their performances radically changes, becoming maddening and corrupt, and the more it fails and is rejected, the greater their spiral into abuse, depression and further madness. Scorned by their former patrons and society at large, they become conduits for the vile influence of the Abyssal Princes, but deep down, they feel that they are still following their muse – even if it has twisted into a blasphemous form. Look no further than the work of Malen Fulci and his painting, ‘The Beyond’, to understand the grotesqueries of a Maestro turned to madness and chaos."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least two Skill Ranks in Tradecraft in order to enter this Expert Profession."},"archetype":{"value":"Expert Profession"},"bonusAdvances":[{"name":"[AB]"},{"name":"[AB]"},{"name":"[FB]"},{"name":"[IB]"},{"name":"[PB]"},{"name":"[WB]"},{"name":"[WB]"}],"skillRanks":[{"name":"Awareness"},{"name":"Charm"},{"name":"Coordination"},{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Folklore"},{"name":"Resolve"},{"name":"Rumor"},{"name":"Scrutinize"},{"name":"Simple Melee"},{"name":"Tradecraft"}],"talents":[{"linkedId":null,"name":"Determination"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Secret Signs"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Worldly"}],"professionalTrait":{"name":"Virtuoso","linkedId":null},"specialTrait":{"name":"","linkedId":null},"drawback":{"name":"Celebrity Status","linkedId":null},"tier":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9cilLhNTlIyJpmtZ":3},"flags":{"zweihander":{}}}

The Black Lodge lends an inkling of its power to occultists, whether they be human or Fey, but this power is far too extreme and obtuse to handle through the standard traditions of Magick. Instead, those blessed by the Black Lodge intone haunting melodies, ones that erode the Æthereal Veil and allow the whispers of the Black Lodge to creep back into our reality. These unsettling troubadours are known as Dirgesingers, and are the primary proselytizers of the Black Lodge ‘faith’... if it can be called that. They are taciturn and inscrutable – though their manner comes to be marked by a capriciousness as the seasons pass – making them inscrutable and alien indeed.\\nManipulating the Æthereal winds merely with their voice, a Dirgesinger warps both their voice and the winds into something both haunting and beautiful, frightening and tearful.

Those of an older age begin to take upon an unmistakable tree-like appearance. They suffer from wart- like lesions that grow under their skin and nails. Their flesh takes on the texture of rotted wood. Insects and animals nest in their clothes and hair. Their songs turn from laments of loss to wails of pain.

Others are run off of lands, either by territorial animals who have sensed a threat or a Gamekeeper who has had too many animals killed. Trapper are adept at not only making and laying traps, but spotting and disarming them too, from simple snares to complex arrow traps. They also possess great survival instincts and are excellent guides, but the stress of adventuring is entirely different from that gained from hiding in a tree waiting for your mark to approach.

Every Assassin has their favored tools, but all use disguises, concealment and forgery to accomplish their goal.\nAssassins rarely adventure into the wider world – their home is in the city, full of wealthy benefactors and spurned lovers. Those that do are fleeing something – often with another Assassin hot on their tail (Assassins see other Assassins as the targets truly worthy of cold calculated methods). Assassins kill without being there and with people hearing what they want them to, making them useful in countless situations. The true hindrance to any Assassin is too much evidence, too many witnesses, too little alibi.

This is all in the hope that their peers will look favorably upon them and grow to be a Fell Knight. It is the only thing they desire more than glory on the battlefield.\\nAt first sight, Howling  Marauders seem to have no culture aside from outright barbarism, but that is not the case.

Infighting is extremely common among the tribes, so much so that brother often runs brother through in the heat of battle. Howling Marauders do not hate those who have not tasted Corruption; they are not enemies, but rather mewling babes who have yet to taste the sweet nectar of life.

They are direct and menacing, never wasting an action in combat and capable of clearing a rowdy tavern with their presence. The Pledged Guard is easily swayed by coin, however, readily switching alliances for better pay, no matter how foul their ward is.

Thus, the Outsider has few followers, but those He does have are called the Openers Of The Way. Their overarching goal is to root out the religion of the Abyssal Princes wherever it spreads, so as for the Outsider to have carte blanche to rule. Openers Of The Way strive to honor their anarchic lord through agnosticism and contradiction. The forces of the Outsider do not believe in the existence of any god or Daemon, save their own. Even then, belief that the Outsider is truly real is sometimes questioned by his occultists. Openers Of The Way are truly queer specimens, but their goal stands clear: kill all believers.\\nJourneying with an Opener Of The Way is often a strange and paradoxical experience, as they are allying themselves with a follower of a former Abyssal Daemon whose sole purpose is to fight other Abyssal Daemons. Openers outwardly attract trouble, very rarely veiling their purpose or allegiance, and tend to seek out powerful demons and their ilk to destroy. When there are none left to suffer the vengeance of the Outsider, Openers turn their eyes towards the commonly-accepted faiths to squash. Their outward agnosticism means they care little for their safety or the safety of others who join them in these tasks, simply seeing them as hindrances, holding them back from their mission. So, they prefer to work alone, but what they do not realize is that the Abyss feeds on isolation, as corruptible Openers Of The Way may end up being swayed to another Daemon, another casualty of the Outsider’s liberation."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least one Skill Rank in Incantation in order to enter this Expert Profession.

Wearing a long, bird-like mask stuffed with herbs and spices to block out the smell of decay, Plague Doktors explore festering sores, amputate limbs, apply leech therapy and watch people die from hundreds of nasty illnesses. This includes Magickal diseases born from mutation and the stench of the Abyss that bring a host of new challenges. For patients, treatment can be as deadly as the disease – there are no antibiotics or anesthesia; the only alternatives being a prayer to the gods and a bottle of rotgut.\nSome Plague Doktors rarely leave their surgical theaters, but others are natural wanderers, traveling the world looking for cures and discovering even stranger diseases. The entire countryside is sick, so they have little remorse leaving behind ‘regulars’ in search of new breakthroughs. Highly intelligent and inquisitive, Plague Doktors employ scientific methods in their research and while some are amazing healers, their abilities are limited by their scientific knowledge. Being a Plague Doktor is grim and gruesome work; hearing the screams of your patient as you burn the stub that was once their hand, watching children cough up blood or seeing a friend succumb to mutation places a massive strain on their mental state. This can make some Plague Doktors erratic and unstable – and worse, drive others to see that the only way to find cures is to examine their symptoms again and again, which means spreading disease after disease.

Every object and person has a price, and if something untoward happens to a person or property, the guilty party is required as a penance to pay the weregild to victims. However, not everyone is willing to make these reparations. Enter the Kinslayer, whose job it is to collect the weregild through use of force. If necessary, Kinslayers can be utterly ruthless in their execution of duty, for their mandate includes the broad authority to do basically anything in order to retrieve a weregild and hand it over to its rightful owners – even if it involves murder. Often, the reputation of a Kinslayer is enough that word of their being hired will persuade the guilty party to pay the weregild. Though many other civilizations have mostly abandoned the idea of weregild and their Kinslayer enforcers, Gnomes roundly embrace its ideals. They openly boast of the ‘heroic’ Vigilante-turned- Kinslayer, where Gnomish bastard-borne amalgams of Elves and Dwarves are less upset about someone in their extended family being murdered, and more upset about the production that murder halted. Being a Kinslayer requires tenacity, apathy, ruthlessness and a little jadedness, all of which Gnomes embody in spades. Since Gnomes despise even their own, it is no wonder that they hold Kinslayer justicars in such high regard.\\nMake no mistake: Kinslayers are killers, through and through. Many become entranced with this lifestyle, as there is great money to be made in being a professional killer – living off the reputation of being a professional killer. Such Kinslayers become more interested in the gaudy clothes, expensive carriages and fine food that their duties can buy rather than in carrying them out. The worst Kinslayers are those that steal weregild and keep it for themselves – some even steal property because they believe to be the rightful inheritor of the bounty. These Kinslayers are not officially supported, but their esteem and celebrity means many common folk have at least heard rumors of the worst of the Kinslayers. The Daemon Princes do so love the Kinslayer, as this greed and avarice is sure to bring other disenfranchised people to follow these decadent lifestyles and do the same: to throw the world further into chaos."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least one Skill Rank in Resolve in order to enter this Expert Profession."},"archetype":{"value":"Expert Profession"},"bonusAdvances":[{"name":"[AB]"},{"name":"[AB]"},{"name":"[BB]"},{"name":"[CB]"},{"name":"[CB]"},{"name":"[WB]"},{"name":"[WB]"}],"skillRanks":[{"name":"Awareness"},{"name":"Intimidate"},{"name":"Martial Melee"},{"name":"Resolve"},{"name":"Ride"},{"name":"Rumor"},{"name":"Simple Melee"},{"name":"Simple Ranged"},{"name":"Stealth"},{"name":"Survival"}],"talents":[{"linkedId":null,"name":"Appalling Mien"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"No Mercy"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Rural Sensibility"}],"professionalTrait":{"name":"Blood Oath","linkedId":null},"specialTrait":{"name":"","linkedId":null},"drawback":{"name":"Dead Or Alive","linkedId":null},"tier":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9cilLhNTlIyJpmtZ":3},"flags":{"zweihander":{}}}

Vampire Hunters possess limited knowledge about the foes they seek to destroy, due to the lack of scientific understanding of vampire’s ecology and true weaknesses. Thus, they rely on folklore and apocrypha to prepare themselves. It is said that there is no such thing as an inexperienced Vampire Hunter and that they are often ‘made’ into hunters having somehow survived a vampire’s reign of terror.

The Prince of Pleasure sees this as an opportunity to subtly plant His Daemonic seed, so thus sending one of His Ecstatic Celebrants to the door of their estates in order to spread the dark prince’s influence. Celebrants pose as well-landed bon vivants or wondrous mystics, come to offer the pleasures of the wider world to those who are bored of calcio and have had enough of primero. Once welcomed into manor houses by their curious patrons, the Ecstatic Celebrant quickly gets to work, leading the vapid nobility into pleasures unheard of… as well as pains. Saying that they will soon unlock ‘ultimate bliss’, the Ecstatic Celebrant organizes secret clubs of libertines and debauchees. These sybarites fill their nights with Bacchic carousing, opioid-induced spirit journeys, joyous erotica and self-mutilation, only to bring decadence to its final level, cavorting in the foul halls of the Prince of Pleasure Himself.\\nEcstatic Celebrants ooze charisma. With but a word, they can instill orgasmic nocturnal emissions in an attentive student or send a joyous convert spiraling down into endless pain with a brush of their fingertips. Heedless of the dangers involved, Celebrants seek to experience every and any type of amusement and torment imaginable, so that they can ‘share’ it with others through their insidious whisperings. This of course will drive them into the arms of lunacy, but the Prince of Pleasure cares little for His occultist’s madness, for the dark prince loves to see them writhe in their own wanton, joyous destruction. He, too, was born from mankind’s willingness to engage in jubilant decadence and self-destructive hubris, so the Prince of Pleasure knows He will always hold sway for time immemorial. This is why many Ecstatic Celebrants do not even know that they glorify Him – they are simply too far removed from reality to realize that their debauchery is fueling the Prince’s destructive ends."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least one Skill Rank in Incantation in order to enter this Expert Profession.

A Witch Doktor is not that hard to spot – their erratic behavior, scant method of dress and constant gibbering makes their fate at the hands of any Inquisitor (or individual who does do not suffer the heretic to live) who sees them a foregone conclusion. Yet for the hordes who follow Witch Doktors wholeheartedly, there comes a tipping point – some become so powerful, that they snap entirely. They switch from manic to a placid, sage-like calm, and their power invokes the true fury of the Slavering Maw.

Undoubtedly bedlamites, risk-takers and thrill seekers, this does not stop adventuring parties from making fast friends with Barnstormers; after all, having an ally with a fast vehicle or a getaway driver is extremely tempting.

The Custodian – the mysterious goddess of dreams and death – uses dreams to speak to Her devoted priesthood, the Augurs. As priests of the lady of death, Augurs hold that death is a part of the great cycle and grateful for the life given to them rather than the ending they must brood upon. Reserved rather than morose, Augurs serve as attendants to the dead – embalming and burying them for their journey to the Well. They also spend their lives in reflection of their dreams, and have obtained gifts of revelation and insight into the future and the nature of dreams. From under their dark and bilious cloaks, they prognosticate the fate of all men. It is even said that Augurs know the nature of the death that awaits every man, though their descriptions of such events are vague.\nAugur temples are dark and cold, for this is where they prepare the dead for burial and the afterlife. The Custodian is an inevitability, rather than a welcomed figure, and it is rare for anyone other than Augurs to actively worship her. To Augurs, the supernatural is the highest blasphemy against their lady, stealing souls that rightfully belong to the Well of Souls.

The Legal system never tires though, people are tried, acquitted, jailed or even executed, worked and driven by the much maligned Barrister. Barristers are lawyers, litigants and mediators, spending their lives studying the law in order to convince the often waif court of their pledge’s innocence. Theirs is a thankless job – they go through years of training and study, only to be spat upon if they lose a case despite the impossibilities stacked against them. Most work for those who can afford their often extortionate fees, but some Barristers specialize in legal interpretation, criminal prosecution or become the official representatives of the nobility or even royalty. The rewards for serving as such legal representatives is high – elevation to minor nobility and with it, lands, titles and income. When such legal representatives fail to successfully represent their masters in court, the punishment is very rarely death. Usually they suffer the sentence that their masters would have, had they been found guilty instead. Unless the Barrister can prove their innocence, this usually marks the end of their legal careers.\nBarristers would appear to be ill-equipped for a life of exile, but they know how to protect themselves, both verbally and physically, having learned to defend themselves against their more unhinged clientele. Those that do not go into exile, stay and play a role as society’s inside man – easily researching legal loopholes, forgiving debts or even bending the ear of a noble or royalty. When they do work, most Barristers have their clients’ best interests in mind, but the power to ruin lives, to gouge clients for unpaid fees and seeing the innocent unjustly sent to their deaths, begins to grind most Barristers down.

Among these others, is a singular provost whose duty it is to excise heresy from within – and that is the Exorcist. An Exorcist does not have access to the Magickal prayers of their more mystical brethren, but what they do possess is the unique ability to cast out haunts and spirits from the possessed. The layman may think exorcism involves the simple laying on of hands and incanting a few words, but it is much more complicated than that. Every spirit, haunt or other foul abomination is different, and the Exorcist must adapt to each of them on the fly. Exorcists are more feared than respected, both among the common folk and fellow members of their church, but both see the unique abilities wielded by Exorcists as necessary if corruption is to be driven out. Their skills and their perspicacity means that Exorcists can come to rank nearly as high as Inquisitors, but however high they ascend in the church hierarchy, their approach will always inspire trepidation.\\nThough many Exorcists are given their assignments by an Abbot, others operate as freelancers, leading an itinerant life in search of those who are driven to seek their help. They travel the countryside, moving from village to village and town to town, where with detective-like precision, they expose hoaxes and put to rest real hauntings. Some are hucksters, convincing people that they are ‘plagued by spirits’ and offering their services for a hefty fee. Exorcists may not be intimidating combatants, but what they lack in martial spirit is made up in spades by their being intimately knowledgeable about the occult and taboo subjects – including the nature of worlds beyond our own. Unsurprisingly, Exorcists are prone to possession by spirits and daemons themselves. Some chase away their experiences with deliriants, but more than a handful have thrown themselves from balconies after taking in a spirit that was haunting a young girl or frail widow. Sadly, most Exorcists find their lives on the receiving end of the vitriol and vengeance of the spirits they fight, leaving them ripped asunder by forces unknown or confined to an asylum."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least one Skill Rank in both Education and Folklore in order to enter this Expert Profession."},"archetype":{"value":"Expert Profession"},"bonusAdvances":[{"name":"[AB]"},{"name":"[FB]"},{"name":"[FB]"},{"name":"[IB]"},{"name":"[PB]"},{"name":"[WB]"},{"name":"[WB]"}],"skillRanks":[{"name":"Bargain"},{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Folklore"},{"name":"Guile"},{"name":"Interrogation"},{"name":"Resolve"},{"name":"Rumor"},{"name":"Scrutinize"},{"name":"Simple Melee"},{"name":"Skulduggery"}],"talents":[{"linkedId":null,"name":"Impervious Mind"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Nerves of Steel"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Supernatural Paranoia"}],"professionalTrait":{"name":"Spiritus Sanctus","linkedId":null},"specialTrait":{"name":"","linkedId":null},"drawback":{"name":"Libera A Malo","linkedId":null},"tier":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9cilLhNTlIyJpmtZ":3},"flags":{"zweihander":{}}}

Though Physikers are finally starting to understand the body and how people get sick, the mind remains an enigma. Many explore the reaches of the conscious, trying to figure out what makes people tick. The most common method of this is hypnotism, and those who devote themselves to hypnotism and the workings of the ‘mental machine’ call themselves Alienists. The average Alienist speaks calmly and soothingly, assuring their convalescent that what they are experiencing is completely ‘normal’. They then subject their patients to tests with all sorts of medieval and unusual devices like calipers and silver charms, before plunging them into a twilight dream-state to find out what haunts them. Alienists are often employed by the rich and powerful, but often they care little if they are actually helping or not – most are striving to find a breakthrough that will grant them medical acclaim. Alienists may truly have developed an understanding of the mind’s mysteries, but even if this approach is not ‘real’, the placebo effect it can have on patients is certainly determinable.\\nAlienists are not well-trusted by the common populace nor the priesthood, as the idea of someone ‘picking around in your head’ is not something most rational people find appealing. Regardless, Alienists see the power that hypnotism and suggestion can have. They pose as innocent enough, worming their way into haughty circles of blue-bloods or in with jumped up burghers who crave a social status a notch above their peers. The Alienist’s end goals may be to eventually entrance these fools and request they reveal family secrets and treasures, or entreat them to far worse outcomes under suggestive influence. Understandably, those desperate and truly damaged long for their problems to be fixed, and thus turn to this heinous form of treatment. Corruption loves a good Alienist, as it allows them to infiltrate their filth and hatred into someone’s subconscious willingly, leading to a servant who runs less on suggestion and more on animal instinct."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least one Skill Rank in Heal in order to enter this Expert Profession."},"archetype":{"value":"Expert Profession"},"bonusAdvances":[{"name":"[FB]"},{"name":"[FB]"},{"name":"[IB]"},{"name":"[IB]"},{"name":"[PB]"},{"name":"[WB]"},{"name":"[WB]"}],"skillRanks":[{"name":"Charm"},{"name":"Education"},{"name":"Folklore"},{"name":"Guile"},{"name":"Heal"},{"name":"Interrogation"},{"name":"Resolve"},{"name":"Rumor"},{"name":"Scrutinize"},{"name":"Simple Melee"}],"talents":[{"linkedId":null,"name":"Incredible Numeration"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Secret Signs"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Supernatural Paranoial"}],"professionalTrait":{"name":"Doktor Mind-Bender","linkedId":null},"specialTrait":{"name":"","linkedId":null},"drawback":{"name":"Placebo Effect","linkedId":null},"tier":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9cilLhNTlIyJpmtZ":3},"flags":{"zweihander":{}}}

Leather, meat, lard and bone are all bounties that beasts of the land can provide. As a result, thievery of livestock is fairly rampant, often committed by the devious Rustler. Rustlers like to strike when livestock is being herded for sale prior to being branded. Come nightfall, they will dispatch the unfortunate shepherd and their watch dogs, then drive the animals themselves to sell for a bounty. Rustlers rarely act alone and in lands of sweeping prairies and far-apart settlements, they are often more common than bandits. Selling the livestock is usually the easiest part of the Rustler’s task. After all, no one in the settlement where the herd’s original owner was going to sell it is likely to know what the herd looks like or who its original owner was, so the Rustler simply walks in, sells the stolen beasts and pockets the profits. At other times, Rustlers are not in it for money, but rather in desperation–having turned to stealing cattle in order to feed their starving villages or appease despotic rulers. Unsurprisingly, when stealing the herds of others, Rustlers often wear a neckerchief over their faces so as to prevent their countenance from being discovered.\\nRustlers know as much about the lay of the land as any hunter does, plus they know how to operate in secrecy fairly well. They also possess a powerful persuasiveness when it comes to handling animals. Yet the loneliness of their thievery, the emptiness of the wilderness when it is not full of slavering monsters or horrors and the threat of punishment should they be caught, can push Rustlers to the edge of sanity – and beyond. Such men snap and instead of having a care for the animals they wish to rustle and steal, they grow heartless. Severe and cruel to both man and animal, they take up with the dregs of humanity, or worse, allow themselves to be recruited into the ranks of cults who follow the call of Daemons. Such Rustlers can obtain fresh sacrifices with little hassle and are willing to drive chattel off cliffs or leave without a shepherd in the middle of a wolf-haunted forest. The beast-like Grendel employ Rustlers to round up both animals to mate with and shepherds to defile.

Each of the races has its own specialized entertainers, whether it is the Dwarven boasters, the Elves making performances out of shaping and sculpting trees with Magick or Halfling’s rather unappetizing feats of ‘meat juggling’. Entertainers typically have a specialty as well as other skills, but nearly all of them are charismatic, intelligent and often, a little underhanded. Depending on their talent and medium, Entertainers may be hated or adored, but few ever achieve widespread fame.\nUnless the court bard for a wealthy aristocrat, being an Entertainer rarely pays the bills or puts food on the table. So some Entertainers choose to sharpen their quills into swords and take up a life of crypt-delving and bloodshed. Given this grisly line of work, most are more at home in public houses, courts, at masquerades and on street corners.

Crime Bosses lead entire networks of gangs, directing their activities, keeping them paid while taking a cut and with a bribe or three, protecting them from the law. They often achieve wealth and influence, even as much as any lord or lady, as few wish to incur the wrath of a band of cutthroats and bruisers. Those Crime Bosses that survive are not foolish or brash, often being subtle strategists, knowing when to eliminate threats; who to intimidate, bribe or blackmail; and where and when to expand their business interests and their territories. They always seem like friends at first sight, but they are ruthless behind the smile and they know where the bodies are buried – and where the bodies should be buried.\nCrime Bosses possess low cunning and perplexity, but their cleverness is not the only reason why they lead city-wide criminal networks – they are quick and stealthy, able to slit throats and coin purses with a skill beyond the men who work for them. They live paranoid lives, fearing betrayal from below and arrest from above, but they know how to survive close scrapes and near misses and are ready to retaliate should the need arise. Their paranoia claws at the Crime Boss’ mind, pushing them to acts of brutality, not as acts of retaliation, but as a pre-emptive strike before some upstarts makes a jealous and inevitably bloody bid for power (just as they once did before they were Crime Bosses). This drives them to take a tighter grip on their gangs and their operations and so they turn from what was once a despised but necessary evil into a maniac who controls a town’s underworld with a bloody iron fist."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least two Skill Ranks in Skulduggery in order to enter this Expert Profession."},"archetype":{"value":"Expert Profession"},"bonusAdvances":[{"name":"[BB]"},{"name":"[BB]"},{"name":"[FB]"},{"name":"[FB]"},{"name":"[PB]"},{"name":"[WB]"},{"name":"[WB]"}],"skillRanks":[{"name":"Interrogate"},{"name":"Intimidate"},{"name":"Leadership"},{"name":"Resolve"},{"name":"Rumor"},{"name":"Scrutinize"},{"name":"Skulduggery"},{"name":"Toughness"},{"name":"Simple Melee"},{"name":"Simple Ranged"}],"talents":[{"linkedId":null,"name":"Appalling Mien"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Gangster Grip"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Menacing Demeanor"}],"professionalTrait":{"name":"Skin O’ My Teeth","linkedId":null},"specialTrait":{"name":"","linkedId":null},"drawback":{"name":"Public Enemy","linkedId":null},"tier":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9cilLhNTlIyJpmtZ":3},"flags":{"zweihander":{}}}

They excel in the martial arts and act with an incredible precision. Oftentimes, Sworn Swords pledge themselves to a noble house, serving as judicial champions in all capacities.

Many Chamberlains are taken for granted, although a select few are treated as trusted friends and the right-hand of the noble they serve.

This boils down to two main roles: distributing munitions or tactical navigation. Most Quartermasters within an army emphasize the former purpose, while the navy Quartermaster emphasizes the latter. Quartermasters have the trust of their senior officers, but they are also able to interact with foot soldiers and mercenaries to ensure battle preparedness. Their position is extremely valued by warriors of all stripes, because without enough provisions or the right direction, these soldiers and sailors are as good as dead. The Quartermaster is more than aware of this position and they take it with quite some pride, though often that can be misinterpreted as arrogance.\\nSome Quartermasters eventually leave their military units, trading in their skills in cartography and logistics for opportunity and coin. An adventuring party is a perfect place for a Quartermaster, as they can make even the longest hike through a mountain pass seem like an afternoon stroll. Sometimes, the group becomes so reliant on them, that the Quartermaster’s ego grows to the point where they believe themselves superior to others. This kind of sedition can bring about smaller food shares over misunderstandings, refusal to listen to other people’s directions and a general sense of ‘never being wrong’.

Their mix of the esoteric and the practical, scholarship and worldliness, gives them a curious skillset – unheard of for arcanists, they have a knack for swordsmanship, used to travel and are skilled diplomats. Their vow of pragmatism and poverty aids their diplomatic skills, as they cannot be easily persuaded by coin or worldly goods.\nHowever, upon these roads less traveled, these grey pilgrims can become twisted by their own sense of secrecy. The constant need for secrecy and to hide their motives, means that Illusionists feel better prepared to hide their infernal pursuits should their search for knowledge and secrets take them in such a direction. Despite being masters of deception, witch hunters have an uncanny knack to sniff out renegade illusionists."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least one Skill Rank in Incantation in order to enter this Expert Profession.

Where demonic beings propagate chaos, disaster, darkness and destruction, Hierophants bring radiance, order and healing, their power being derived from light. Many give off an air of scholarly knowledge and wisdom, but while quiet and reserved, they can be judgmental and deem themselves more important or influential than other wizards. This is because of the intense pride they take in both their Magick and its purity. Their arrogance does not go unnoticed by other arcanists, but the proof is in their abilities; they can heal the sick, protect those in danger and bring hope where there is none.\nBesides their superiority and aloofness, Hierophants are typically zealous when it comes to opposing the forces of chaos. Steeped in the study of purity and enlightenment, there is always a certain detachment to Hierophants, a detachment that can grow in battling the forces of chaos. If it grows too much, it can be joined by a fascination with their foes and all too readily, a Hierophant is not just battling chaos but attempting to understand and master it. Such apostates become Luminescence’s harshest critics and servants of a ‘universal law of purity’ that only they can envision. Enacting their sense of twisted order generally leads to terrible endings for the ‘unenlightened’, made victim to the Hierophant’s misguided understandings."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least one Skill Rank in Incantation in order to enter this Expert Profession.

In Bloodblitz, savagery reigns, save from a universal ‘no-weapons allowed’ rule. Blitzballers otherwise have free reign to throat punch, eye-gouge and land cheap shots on members of the opposing team.

This scattershot landscape is borne from the terrible war machines that have entered the theatre of conflict… and the Artillerists who operate them. Artillerists maintain and man a host of infernal machines upon the fields of battle. They work hand-in-hand with Engineers to find their enemies’ weak points, strongest defensive positions, and most important sites of strategic value – in fact, many Artillerists were once Engineers themselves. In general, it is the common Man-At-Arms who does the actual firing of war machines, but they would be useless if it was not for the Artillerist’s ever-vigilant eye. Obviously, this makes them high priority targets – the bolt throwers and cannons whose fire they direct can rip frontlines apart, so targeting them – whether by a Sharpshooter or a strike squad – makes both perfect tactical sense and prevents many casualties.\\nIt is no wonder that many take to adventuring instead, or even loaning out their services to higher bidders (mercenary- minded as they are). Like all military men, Artillerists can defend themselves, but they are most dangerous behind the ballast of a catapult or the giant windlasses of a bolt thrower. The life of an Artillerist is not easy – the constant strain on their senses while standing next to war machines leave many deaf or with ragged vocal cords, while others have found themselves maimed or killed after a cannon has misfired or the arm of a trebuchet snaps under the strain.\\nIt is a career of deep lows and soaring highs, with little in between. While the drums of war may beat as soldiers take to the field, Artillerists are generally focused on waiting for an opening through which their great war machines can pound their enemies without harming their friends. Unfortunately, not every cannon or catapult is as accurate as Artillerists claim and their commanders would want. Nor is every Artillerist as skilled as they claim. Which at best often means that the field of battle is littered with miscalculated shots and at worst, an Artillerist’s comrades- at-arms face the danger of being crushed, blown apart, or impaled by friendly fire.

Their finesse is prized in many arenas, with some performing in tournaments during summer months and turning to hunting in the colder seasons The Sharpshooter is silent, calm and collected, able to drive an arrow through a helm’s eye slit at over 50 paces. It is no wonder why so many are acclaimed, travelling from tourney to tourney, commanding large purses and the accolades of the nobles who sponsor them as they put on display their sharpshooting skills.\\nSharpshooters are not necessarily great warriors, but they are great shots do appreciate opportunities to test their skill. There is no greater place to test their skill than on the field of battle where they are employed to target important individuals. In comparison to the simple man-at-arms, the tactics employed by Sharpshooters take advantage of their skill, their stealth, and their ability to separate the man from the target. It is no longer another man they are targeting with a shot, but rather just a bullseye to shoot – and another purse to be won depending upon the terms of their contract. Both this disconnect and willingness to kill another being tends to break at the most inopportune of times, like when they are given the order to attack a helpless serf or their younglings.

Grand Masters wield nearly as much power and respect as some rulers, granted special dispensations by both the clergy and state alike to operate unfettered by the law. Veterans of countless campaigns, they are military leaders and advisers of great skill, earning the respect of their peers and sometimes the jealousy of religious figures and powerful politicians. It is rare to find a Grand Master living a sheltered life, for the horn of war is trumpeted often. Grand Masters wade into battle pauldron-to-pauldron with their brothers and sisters, resplendent in gleaming armor and their order’s banner snapping in the wind above their head.

They are the teeth in the darkness and the talons in the night. Theirs is of strength and lust and power: they are the dread Reaver. These born-and-bred fighters come from cultures where resources are sparse and the land is hard – meaning the only way for them to survive is by raiding and plundering others. Many Reaver tribes will threaten at first, demanding tribute and fealty in exchange for a merchant or even a village being spared their ravages. If they refuse, Reavers will hold no mercy, putting coach, caravan and village to the flame, slaughtering guards and militia, before taking livestock, riches and slaves. That does not make them savages, however – Reavers are people just like everyone else, but their violence is an adaptation they have had to make if they are to survive. Most simply know no other way, and see their plunder as a form of placating their violent gods and ensuring that their family survives. Most Reavers are nomadic and horse-borne, but some do take to shallow-drafted, dragon-prowed boats to sail up and down coastlines and far up rivers in search of communities to raid and plunder. Reavers of this sort pay tribute to far older gods than those prayed to in the hallowed halls of civilized humanity. Despite their seafaring ways, they have learned to fear the Leviathan and His storm-Daemons who thunder above. Rarely though do they travel without their trusty steed, however, borne upon boats shoulder-to- shoulder with their masters.\\nReavers will often sacrifice the good of the individual for the good of the group – the sick, elderly or weak are usually expelled or even killed, and poor leaders are cut down. Children who are born lame or sick are often tossed to the wolves, or Martyr’s mercy, buried by their grieving parents. Most cast-aside Reavers are these scorned warriors who have lost everything, and must either live as outcasts or go through terrible trials to return to their peoples and loved ones. These stalwarts – usually bent, broken or misshapen – are usually sullen and taciturn, but extremely intimidating to the common folk. Sadly, they may also be the people closest to Corruption – many of their gods or Daemons they pay tribute to can be traced in some way to the Abyssal Princes. In fact, stories abound of entire tribes transformed into horrifically mutated Howling Marauders in a fortnight.

Manifestations of the terrible Abyssal Princes of the endless pit, these worms convince such priests that their life-long faith has been a lie, their true devotion to a clever ruse created by the forces of chaos and they are the only true deities. With this realization, the faith that these priests had in the gods grows loathsome and twisted and they become Dark Disciples. Some wander from town to town as crazed scaremongers, preaching the end of reality as we know it; some reject the gods entirely, coming to see themselves as the focus of earthly god-like might; others simply supplicate themselves before the newly-revealed Abyssal powers.\nDark Disciples must hide their change in faith, as even the hint of their worshipping Abyssal powers is reason enough for them to be burned at the stake. Yet when their Abyssal masters actively respond to them in ways their former gods no longer do, Dark Disciples have little choice but to look over the edge of ruin, staring into the ever-roiling maw of the Abyss and questioning not whether, but when, to jump. Only the strongest and most insane resist the call while still trying to make sense of its whispering.

They traditionally study a single weapon, ‘bonding’ with it as one does a beloved pet. Of all weapons, the long and deadly greatsword is often the implement of choice. The Bladedancer’s ideology revolves around inward and outer grace, harmoniously living in simpatico with nature far removed from civilization in a hermitage, all to prepare body and mind for the study of their martial art. In order to achieve true equilibrium with the world around them, Bladedancers meditate, perform intricate ceremonies by rote, and even create art and poetry to align their martial spirit with their mortal self. But when battle rears its head, they put down the quill and pick up the sword, carrying the careful strokes of the brush they applied to parchment forward into the melee. Bladedancers then paint the battlefield not with ink, but with the blood of their enemies.\\nAs a result of their training, many Bladedancers are oftentimes aloof and distant, either feeling themselves superior to others or just generally apathetic. This can make them hard to deal with, but the force of their personality, mind for tactics and martial poise are all but unparalleled. The Bladedancer tradition is long and mysterious, and some whisper that certain members of their orders do more than meditate and practice with their weapons. Such Bladedancers seek both revelation and sorcerous abilities to bolster their martial power from cult-like religions that have been banned by civilized society. There may be a kernel of truth to such rumors, for while Bladedancers try to bend instead of break, when they do break – they break hard. If they do suffer this fate, many Bladedancers would rather fall upon their swords than give into to the vile promises of Daemons.

Cock-sure and confident to a fault, brimming with their titular ‘bravado’, Bravos come from many walks of life, but all have minds as sharp as the weapons they wield.\nThe Bravo’s charm takes them far, bedding married men and women with ease, only to escape out a window at sunrise; winning hands of cards with a smile and perhaps an extra card up their sleeves; and defusing fights with a quip, but eventually they must protect their honor, word, and reputation with a duel. This forces them to move from town to town and even take up the life of an adventurer. Many find mere adventuring barbaric; there being no honor in slaying monstrous rats in sewers or running footpads through. However, identify a worthy adversary and a Bravo will live for the epic duel against them and the chance to speak of it afterwards. Their braggadocio is both a gift and a curse, as the Bravo’s big mouth and larger attitude can easily put them in chains, on the rack or in the grave.

At times, when this is not enough, a champion of the people rises up to take on the mantle of Mootwarden. As provincial peasant-heroes, they see it as their duty not to focus on attacking active threats, but to deter unwanted visitors and persuade them to move on. Mootwardens lead border patrols, staying out of sight while watching for threats attempting to enter the settlement they are protecting. Any unwanted intruder, beast or monstrosity who makes such an attempt are either deterred or dealt with, depending on the situation.\\nAs more of the countryside is settled, and travel between settlements is increasingly commercialized, Mootwardens are becoming a rarity. However, they are still found in the service of those remote settlements which do not fall under the jurisdiction of some local baron or count, while many Halfling shires proudly employ these ‘wardens of the road’ to shoo away unwanted visitors and so maintain the status quo. Their stealth and dedication to their home is admirable, but can also backfire. As more vicious creatures and unscrupulous bushwhackers encroach upon their lands, the Mootwarden starts to see everything as a threat – from clueless mutts and itinerant peddlers to lost travelers and desperate refugees, even their own kin. Soon the Mootwarden runs all outsiders away from the settlement, believing that only they can preserve the village and that only they know what is best for it.

Despite this, the Crouching One’s name is often invoked over death sentences and vendettas or whispered by the poor and desperate appealing to the Bloodmongers for revenge. This is not as surprising as it sounds, as there are clearly legends of heroic Bloodmonger killers that perform their deeds upon the villainous with a gross sense of justice.

In their hidden temples, their rituals are long and deadly, animal sacrifice is common, since regular sacrifice quickly attracts the Inquisition’s attention. Where blood sacrifice is demanded, but impossible, Bloodmongers ritually leech themselves of their own blood as petty offerings. Either way, spilling too much blood draws the Crouching One’s ire and spilling too little does the same. Bloodmongers hide their worship of the Crouching One, communicating amongst themselves in public via discrete hand signs every worshipper knows, and suppress their madness so as not to draw the Inquisition’s attention.

Unlike members of the nobility they will never govern an entire country or even a county and neither will they take command of an army and take to the field of battle. Instead, a Burgomaster is a petty politician, typically the mayor of one of the many villages that dot the landscape, a village elder of a tribal clan, a seneschal for a province or county, or a spokesperson for a city borough. Burgomasters are generally not elected by their constituents, but are installed by the aristocracy to act in their stead. Burgomasters are a means to an end for the nobility; a necessary cog in the political machine who takes care of local concerns. That being said, they exist only in part because bluebloods lack the time or patience to govern every community beneath their rule. Surprisingly, Burgomasters do make fairly decent strategists, as it is they who organize the militias as part of a town or village’s defense.\\nThat does not necessarily mean that Burgomasters are well-loved by their people. Many are prone to political corruption, levying a sales tax on all goods coming in and going out of village markets; raising taxation to benefit from others’ labor; and hiring out the labor of constituents while skimming off the top – all to line their own coffers. Burgomasters are often not very strong or even that smart, but many are of low cunning, and able to sway individuals to do their dirty work for them. Sometimes such efforts lead to Burgomasters hiring bands of miscreants to protect their interests and to prevent do-gooding adventurers from interfering. However, when they are found out, Burgomasters are forced to flee, often forced to join the miscreants they hired to survive beyond the wooden palisades of the village or the curtain walls of the town they once controlled.

The person who does that is called the Skald, a musician, drummer or speaker whose job is to inspire the troops. Skalds differ from Entertainers in that Skalds are soldiers rather than civilians, albeit specifically trained to boost the morale of the men and women around them. Their tools vary: many modern armies have drum and flute corps, while more tribal people may shout intimidating chants or exaltations of valor. It is even known for Skalds to accompany crusaders in their wars in the holy lands, their Skalds belting out scripture and divine providence to show that god is on their side. When not in the midst of battle, Skalds bring cheer to the troops, sometimes on the march, but usually when encamped, performing raucous songs of victory and love while the soldiers drown their sorrows in ale over comrades and loves lost.\\nSkalds rarely concern themselves with the size or type of military unit they perform for, whether mercenary band or adventuring group, as to them the ballad played to a Squire is much the same as a song played to a Sellsword. One curious aspect of a Skald is their age. Often, in many ‘civilized’ lands, armies will recruit young boys to serve as drummers and fifers – many of these boys being more than willing to join up, typically out of a sense of patriotism as much as adventure. Sadly, exposing children to the often unspeakable sights and horrors of war, having them see their eager comrades and jaded mentors cut down before them and then expecting them to march over their corpses and leave them behind with barely a glance, is not without its consequences. Many go mad far before they reach adulthood, that is, if they are captured and turned into child soldiers by less scrupulous armies and mercenary companies.

Slayers have long heeded the call to destroy chaos in all its forms. Few live long lives though, as Slayers are driven by a singular wish to die a glorious death. Diabolists and other practitioners of Magick also see themselves as hunters of beasts, but only to further their study of the Material Realm. Somewhere between the two is the true professional monster hunter – the Hexer. Graduates of remote schools which combine intense martial training with a study of herbalism, alchemy and toxins, Hexers make their mark upon the world as stalkers of inhuman prey. As a Hexer grows in age and power, so does their understanding of both the natural and supernatural world. Every Hexer worth their salt carries two swords, one wrought of steel to protect themselves against sentient beings, the other of cold iron to fight monsters. If necessary, they coat both blades with oil-based Toxins they specialize in concocting. Hexers are not true warrior-mages, but they do possess an inherent predilection towards simple Magick practices. Most rely on the use of Sigils – elemental-based cantrips traced in the air by hand – to hedge themselves against monsters and their ilk.\\nYet behind the closed doors of every Hexer school, the staff keep a dirty secret. Hexers-to-be, known as ‘potentials’, are usually accepted into the school as children. Some are orphans, others are simply mouths their families can no longer afford to feed. In their first year, they undergo a series of grueling physical and mental trials, culminating in the consumption of a strange mutagenic potion. Imbibing this concoction has three distinct results – transmutation into a Hexer, being driven insane or simply death. If they survive the process, training resumes and they continue to hone their skills until they graduate as a true Hexer. Although some adults have undergone these same trials, it is rare for them to result in anything other than death. However, mutagenic potions have a tendency to corrupt those that imbibe them and unlike their Diabolist cousins, Hexers do not have the same mental fortitude with which to withstand their effects, especially when combined with the corruptive side effects of the Sigils they use. Under the influence of both, their minds begin to twist and contort.

Their wanderlust, however, can turn into quite a problem, as their journeys expose them to less than holy ideas and dishonorable ideals. In the best cases, this results in a conflicting mindset that gives Condottieri a bizarre world view, but not much else. In the worst cases, they fall in with the wrong groups, learn darker knowledge and viler methods, eventually coming to a dark truth that no man living or dead should ever have to face – that there is no truth at all. This revelation can make the Condottieri less a martial champion and more a true butcher of man-flesh. Stories abound of Ogre man-eaters eating the flesh of the dead, boiling meat in a cauldron amidst the carnage to make a stew."},"notes":"","expert":{"value":true,"requirements":"You must possess at least one Skill Rank in Martial Melee in order to enter this Expert Profession."},"archetype":{"value":"Expert Profession"},"bonusAdvances":[{"name":"[AB]"},{"name":"[AB]"},{"name":"[BB]"},{"name":"[IB]"},{"name":"[IB]"},{"name":"[PB]"},{"name":"[WB]"}],"skillRanks":[{"name":"Athletics"},{"name":"Folklore"},{"name":"Intimidate"},{"name":"Leadership"},{"name":"Martial Melee"},{"name":"Resolve"},{"name":"Rumor"},{"name":"Simple Melee"},{"name":"Toughness"},{"name":"Warfare"}],"talents":[{"linkedId":null,"name":"Hard to Kill"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"Impenetrable Wall"},{"linkedId":null,"name":"No Mercy"}],"professionalTrait":{"name":"Soldier of Fortune","linkedId":null},"specialTrait":{"name":"","linkedId":null},"drawback":{"name":"Savagery","linkedId":null},"tier":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9cilLhNTlIyJpmtZ":3},"flags":{"zweihander":{}}}

Often seen as no more than a pampered official, the Bailiff ’s varied responsibilities and occasional need to fend for themselves, makes them broadly skilled, from intimidation tactics to advanced combat maneuvers. Bailiffs often quest to return to a lord’s good graces, to obtain a need employer, or simply to engage in exploitation and thuggery.

Its power flows from the Æthereal Veil and wraps around the world in invisible but destructive zephyrs – Winds that arcanists mold and control according to their whim. Tapping into even one Wind is dangerous enough, as it carries the risk of caster’s body and soul being ripped apart, but there are some arcanists who wish to amplify this power, opening themselves up to a ravaging storm of Ætheric Winds. Those who risk everything for these dark arts are called Black Magisters, at first warned, then shunned by the arcane community at large for meddling in powers they fail to understand. Such warnings often fall on deaf ears as Black Magisters are too self-centered and narcissistic to care for anything beyond their own quest of real, ultimate power. They seek out natural pools of Magickal energy, where all the Winds swirl together in a lightless, fetid mass – known as Void Magick.\nBlack Magisters are nearly always outcasts, perhaps running from zealous Inquisitors or on a spirit quest to understand demonic might from its immortal practitioners. They are not all power mad though, some Black Magisters’ intent is only to learn and discover more about Void Magick. However, regardless of their intent, the arcane might they study or seek is dangerous and a bane to all who wield or are affected by it. Of course, many Black Magisters are driven to seek the power they desire, but worse, others do traffick with Abyssal demons in the search for all that is dark and corrupt.

This leaves time to focus on their Magickal studies, always pushing the edge of their limitations while legitimizing it. Occult Magicians strike many, many deals with a myriad of Daemons; deals that they generally feel are ironclad in their favor.

A replicated painting from the hand of a master forger is nearly indistinguishable from the original, while a Forger’s debased coins invariably stand up to official scrutiny. The Forger has a knack of making something out of nothing, so that their ‘masterpieces’ represent nearly pure profit, even if they are actually worthless.

The crime of forgery is tantamount to treason, which usually results in the Forger being sentenced to an excruciating death (being boiled alive or having the molten metal of forged coins poured down one’s throat are common forms of punishment). Forgers must stay hidden at all times lest they be ousted – for once they are found, the evidence against them is often staggering and there is little hope of a proper trial.

Plus, moving from town-to-town means that they can abscond quickly should a buyer get wise to the counterfeited work. However, as the stress of living weighs down upon a Forger’s head, they soon begin to doubt what is real.
