Roll Chaos Dice as you normally would, but if any land on face &lsquo;6,&rsquo; you are Slain!. You also cannot recover your Damage &amp; Peril Condition Tracks during this time. You must also attempt to Resist again every twenty-four hours, or else suffer the effects again.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> You are now permanently immune to Hemlock.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> You are Slain!.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Considerations:</strong> Before being drugged by Hemlock, you can attempt a (Challenging -10%) Awareness Test to discover that you&rsquo;re being drugged. Use of an Antidote terminates its effects, but won&rsquo;t heal your Damage Condition Track.</p>"
