      "@en": "<p>Fear and conflict have gripped the New World since its founding. From hostile attacks by enemy powers to self-inflicted strife, war is a part of life. I have wrested my own patch of land from the wilderness, but it comes with its own violent price. To live and be truly free, you must know how to shoot and how to stalk, but it is the Militia who knows how to kill. I have answered the call every time to fight for our heaven-sent rights, yet it seems the Loyalists hesitate to respond in defense of their own liberty.</p>\n<p>Whether they believe in liberty, the independence of Indigenous lands or in loyalty to the motherland, I will defend those who need such a shield. When the fighting ceases, which eventually will, I will be scorned for my violence and willingness to strike. Just keep one thing in mind: I am no parish soldier&mdash;if you want to think that, then you&rsquo;ll find hell to pay.</p>"
