Mesmerized foes cannot use any Actions In Combat, but may attempt to Resist again at the beginning of their Turn to escape. The creature cannot use any other Actions while they maintain a Transfixed Gaze. However, they can release the gaze at any time. If the creature suffers Damage while a foe is Mesmerized, they immediately relinquish the hold. Foes who attempt to Resist must flip the results to fail their Skill Test."
