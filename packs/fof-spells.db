Call out the foe&rsquo;s name you wish to torment, and prick the doll with a pin as they move one, two or three steps down the Peril Condition Tracks negatively (your choice). Hold it over a fire, and they suffer from Mildly, Moderately or Seriously Dangerous Fire (your choice). Tie the doll&rsquo;s legs together, and the foe is paralyzed for twenty-four hours. Tie the doll&rsquo;s hands together, and the foe is unable to use their arms for twenty-four hours. Sew the mouth of the doll shut, and the foe is unable to speak for twenty-four hours. Bury it into the earth, and the foe temporarily reduces all of their Primary Attribute Bonuses by -9. If the doll isn&rsquo;t used within a week or is destroyed by fire, the Spell ends. Each time you use the doll, you move one step down the Peril Condition Track and gain 3 Conflict.

Example deeds include blighting a harvest, bringing plague, causing a jury to find someone innocent or guilty, gaining temporary protection from physical or mental harm, harming someone else, killing livestock or teaching Spells. The Historian will determine what is appropriate and help you shape an appropriately devilish request. Then, make a Secret Test using Bargain. The more selfish the deed, the more favorable the Difficulty Rating will be. Success and Critical Success results in the deed being done. Failure and Critical Failure results in your words being twisted against you. You begin to Bleed and gain three Flaw Ranks, no matter whether you succeeded or failed at using this Spell.
